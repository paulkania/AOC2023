#0 stopped working because bittorrent was actively leeching, had to clear those before the script would run again...that's curveball
#1 source dir put to top\
#2 source dir addded escape character
#3 added count [bonus if changed to while true and then add logic to only move if size of file is x>50mb [ie is a video and not text]
